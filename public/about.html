<h2>What is a Hotel?</h2>
<p>
  Broadly speaking, a hotel is a managed building or establishment which
  provides guests with a place to stay overnight – on a short-term basis – in
  exchange for money. The precise features and services provided to guests can
  vary quite drastically from one hotel to another. Hotel owners aim to attract
  a particular type of customer through their pricing model and marketing
  strategy or via the range of services they offer.

<h2>What is The Hotel Industry?</h2>
<p>
  Next, it is important to answer the question: what is the hotel industry? Put
  simply, the hotel industry is the section of the service industry that deals
  with guest accommodation or lodgings. By most definitions, the hotel industry
  refers to hotels and many other forms of overnight accommodation, including
  hostels, motels, inns, and guest houses. However, it does not usually include
  long-term or permanent forms of accommodation. Due to the nature of hotel
  services, it is closely associated with the travel and tourism industry.

<h2>The Difference Between the Hotel Industry and the Hospitality Industry</h2>
<p>
  One common area of confusion concerns the difference between the hotel and the
  hospitality industry, with many people mistakenly believing the two terms
  refer to the same thing. However, while there is a cross-over, the difference
  is that the hospitality industry is broader in scope and includes multiple
  different sectors.
