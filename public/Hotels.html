<h3>AL MAHA, A LUXURY COLLECTION DESERT RESORT & SPA</h3>
<p>
  Al Maha, a Luxury Collection Desert Resort & Spa, is nestled among the lush
  palm groves, emerald canopies and iconic sand dunes of the Dubai Desert
  Conservation Reserve where desert wildlife abounds. Offering secluded
  tranquility and iconic vistas of the sweeping plains and Hajar Mountain
  massif, the property showcases the heritage and architecture of the Bedouins
  and also offers a sense of desert adventure.

<h3>THE BVLGARI RESORT DUBAI</h3>
<p>
  Situated on the exclusive, manmade Jumeira Bay, an island carved into the
  shape of a seahorse and adjoined by a 300 m (980 ft) bridge to central Dubai
  coastline, the Bvlgari Resort Dubai is a true ‘urban oasis’, for visitors and
  residents alike. Designed entirely by Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel, the
  renowned Italian architectural firm that has created all the Bvlgari Hotels &
  Resorts, the sunny property comprises 101 rooms and suites, as well as 20
  Bvlgari villas with pool, garden and sea-view.

<h3>BURJ AL ARAB</h3>
<p>
  The distinctive sail-shaped silhouette of Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, a glittering
  architectural marvel in the middle of the Arabian Gulf, is more than just a
  stunning hotel, it is an emblem of modern Dubai, a world-famous icon, and a
  symbol of extreme wealth, hence making the resort very popular among the rich
  and famous. Still the only (self-proclaimed) 7 star super luxury hotel in the
  world, Burj Al Arab offers oversized suite-only accommodation, with each suite
  composed of two floors that are connected by a marble staircase.
